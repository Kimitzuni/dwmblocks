# dwmblocks
My build of dwmblocks with scripts

Original Repostory [torrinfail/dwmblocks](https://github.com/torrinfail/dwmblocks)

Note: In `blocks.h`, *Update Interval* refers to seconds

## Reason for using DWMblocks
Manually setting when to update as apposed to every single second the script is running.
